# web-scraping-challenge

Web Scrapping and Flask Rendering HMK

This was by far the most difficult assigment so far. I had to put many hours and all my heart on it: I know the code has some flaws and it is perfectible, but I am satisfied with the results. This type of assignments put to test the skills of the students, particullarly the twitter part was very complicated and I needed to invest a significant amount of time, reading, researhing and also sharing points of view with teammates. I hope the result is what was expected. Sincerely and thanks very much, at the end and in hindsight it was worth every minute I invest in it.
